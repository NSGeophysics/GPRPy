* DONE [#A] Add AGC. Button and gprpytool are already there
* DONE [#A] Make Button to set depth/elevation plots 1:1 aspect ratio
* DONE [#A] Add topo correct: Load two files: one with x,y,z or x,z coordinates, one with corresponding profile points
* DONE [#A] Allow to set range of image x and y: Maybe just a button or two instead of the field
* DONE [#A] Implement dzt files: IN PROGESS
* DONE [#A] Display cursor coordinates on canvas
* TODO [#A] make help available for buttons when mouse-over 
* DONE [#A] make logo and put it into splash screen
* TODO [#A] Make picking of coordinates possible
* TODO [#B] Allow plotting of hyperbola to test velocity
* TODO [#B] add filtering: high cut
* TODO [#C] add filtering: spectral
* TODO [#C] add deconvolution
* DONE [#A] Test plotting and printing both regular and GUI
* DONE [#A] Put dewow before time-zero adjust
* DONE [#A] Add AGC and TPOW gain. Put the buttons next to each other, make all other buttons two column span
* DONE [#A] Organize .py files such that only gprpy, gprpyGUI are in the main folder and the others are in a subfolder
* DONE Change such that print with depth now shows meters as unit
* DONE Make y-range double only (similar to input in dewow)
* DONE Make contrast double only (similar to input in dewow)
* DONE In history, when printing, add y-range/contrast into history string
* DONE Add todepth: Need to provide velocity
* DONE make fast dewow for large windows
* DONE make fast rem avg trace for large ntraces
